GitHub Copilot: Looking at your application structure, I can see that you currently have the `/scenario` page redirecting to the main page, but you want to make it useful without duplicating the homepage functionality. Let me analyze your app and suggest several strategic uses for the `/scenario` page.

## Analysis of Current Application Structure

**Current State:**

- Homepage: Calculator + Predefined scenarios + Recent user scenarios (up to 36)
- Individual scenario pages: `/scenario/[slug]` for specific calculations
- `/scenario` page: Currently redirects to homepage

## Strategic Scenarios for `/scenario` Page Usage

### 1. **Comprehensive Scenario Explorer & Discovery Hub**

Transform `/scenario` into a powerful discovery and exploration center:

```tsx
// Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Category filters (retirement, house, education, wealth, emergency)
- Parameter ranges (investment amount, time horizon, return rate)
- Search by goals or keywords
- Sorting options (newest, most viewed, highest returns, etc.)
- Pagination for browsing large numbers of scenarios
```

**Benefits:**

- SEO value for long-tail keywords like "retirement investment scenarios", "house saving calculators"
- Better user experience for scenario discovery
- Increased time on site and engagement

### 2. **Scenario Comparison Tool**

Allow users to compare multiple investment scenarios side-by-side:

```tsx
// Features:
- Select 2-4 scenarios for comparison
- Side-by-side charts and projections
- Difference calculations and analysis
- Export comparison reports
- Save comparison sets
```

**Benefits:**

- Unique functionality not available on homepage
- Helps users make informed investment decisions
- Increases user engagement and return visits

### 3. **Interactive Scenario Builder/Wizard**

Create a step-by-step guided experience:

```tsx
// Multi-step wizard:
Step 1: What's your primary goal? (retirement, house, etc.)
Step 2: What's your timeline? (short/medium/long term)
Step 3: Risk tolerance assessment
Step 4: Current financial situation
Step 5: Generate personalized scenarios
```

**Benefits:**

- More engaging than simple calculator
- Collects user preferences for better recommendations
- Educational component builds trust

### 4. **Scenario Analytics & Insights Dashboard**

Show trends and insights across all scenarios:

```tsx
// Analytics features:
- Most popular investment goals
- Average returns by category
- Success rate analysis
- Market trend integration
- Community insights (anonymized)
```

**Benefits:**

- Valuable content for returning users
- SEO-friendly evergreen content
- Positions your app as authoritative

### 5. **Educational Scenario Library**

Curated learning center with detailed explanations:

```tsx
// Educational content:
- "Beginner's Guide to Investment Scenarios"
- Case studies with real-world examples
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Interactive tutorials
- Video explanations of complex scenarios
```

**Benefits:**

- Builds domain authority
- Attracts organic traffic from educational searches
- Increases user trust and expertise perception

## **Recommended Implementation: Scenario Explorer Hub**

Based on your current setup and SEO goals, I recommend implementing the **Comprehensive Scenario Explorer**:

### Key Features:

1. **Advanced Search & Filtering**

   - Filter by goal type, amount ranges, time horizons
   - Search functionality for finding specific scenarios
   - Tags and categories for easy browsing

2. **Enhanced Display Options**

   - Grid/list view toggle
   - Detailed cards with key metrics
   - Quick preview without leaving the page

3. **User-Generated Content Promotion**

   - "Trending scenarios" section
   - "Most viewed this week"
   - Community favorites

4. **Quick Actions**
   - "Clone and modify" existing scenarios
   - "Share scenario" functionality
   - "Save for later" bookmarking

### SEO Benefits:

- Target keywords: "investment scenario calculator", "retirement planning scenarios", "savings goal calculator"
- Long-tail traffic from specific scenario combinations
- Internal linking opportunities to individual scenario pages
- Fresh content from user-generated scenarios

### Implementation Structure:

```tsx
/scenario page components:
├── SearchAndFilters
├── ScenarioGrid/List
├── TrendingScenarios
├── CategoryTabs
├── PaginationControls
└── QuickActions
```

This approach makes the `/scenario` page a valuable destination that complements rather than duplicates your homepage, while providing significant SEO value and improved user experience.

Would you like me to help implement any of these approaches, or would you prefer to explore a different direction for the `/scenario` page?
