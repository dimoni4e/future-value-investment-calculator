      "investment_overview": "\n    <h2>Comprehensive Investment Plan Overview</h2>\n    <p>Embarking on a financial journey with an initial investment of <strong>{{ initialAmount }}</strong> and consistent monthly contributions of <strong>{{ monthlyContribution }}</strong> positions you for significant wealth accumulation. This strategy is specifically tailored for your {{goal}} objectives, leveraging the power of time and consistency. Over a {{timeHorizon}}-year period, assuming a prudent annual return of {{annualReturn}}, your portfolio is projected to grow to approximately <strong>{{ futureValue }}</strong>.</p>\n    \n    <p>This disciplined investment approach is the cornerstone of successful financial planning. By adhering to this schedule, your total contributions will amount to {{ totalContributions }}, while the magic of compound interest could generate an impressive {{ totalGains }} in pure investment gains. This highlights the efficiency of making your money work for you.</p>\n    \n    <p>The strategy employs <strong>dollar-cost averaging</strong>, a proven technique where regular monthly investments help mitigate the impact of market volatility. By buying more units when prices are low and fewer when they are high, you effectively smooth out the average cost per share over the long term. This is particularly advantageous for {{goal}} planning, where steady, long-term growth is prioritized over short-term speculation.</p>\n    \n    <p>With a {{timeHorizon}}-year horizon, you are well-positioned to benefit from market cycles. The initial years establish your capital base, while the later years capitalize on exponential growth, as your returns begin to generate their own returns—a phenomenon known as compounding.</p>\n  ",
      "growth_projection": "\n    <h2>Detailed Wealth Growth Projection</h2>\n    <p>Your path to financial success starts with {{ initialAmount }} and is fueled by your dedication to adding {{ monthlyContribution }} every month. With a projected annual return of {{annualReturn}}, here is a breakdown of how your wealth is expected to accumulate over the next {{timeHorizon}} years:</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Years 1-5 (Foundation Phase):</strong> In these early years, your investment is projected to grow from {{ initialAmount }} to approximately {{ fiveYearValue }}. The primary driver of growth here is your savings rate. Establishing this habit is crucial for long-term success.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Years 6-10 (Acceleration Phase):</strong> As your portfolio matures, compound interest begins to play a more significant role. Your balance could reach around {{ tenYearValue }}. You'll notice that investment returns start to contribute a larger share of the total growth compared to your contributions alone.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Years 11-{{timeHorizon}} (Compounding Phase):</strong> This is where the \"snowball effect\" takes over. Your portfolio is projected to surge towards {{ futureValue }}. In this phase, annual investment gains may eventually exceed your annual contributions, demonstrating true financial momentum.</p>\n    \n    <p>The mathematical engine driving this growth is <strong>compound interest</strong>—often cited as the most powerful force in finance. It allows you to earn returns on your principal, your contributions, and your accumulated interest. Over {{timeHorizon}} years, your total monthly contributions of {{ monthlyTotal }} are supercharged by this force.</p>\n  ",
      "investment_insights": "\n    <h2>Strategic Investment Insights</h2>\n    <p>Targeting a {{annualReturn}} annual return over a {{timeHorizon}}-year horizon places your portfolio in the {{riskCategory}} category. This target strikes a balance between preserving capital and achieving real growth above inflation.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Risk & Volatility Analysis:</strong> Your profile suggests a {{riskLevel}} risk tolerance. Historically, portfolios aiming for {{annualReturn}} returns have experienced annual volatility in the range of {{volatilityRange}}. It is normal to see fluctuations; however, your long time horizon is your greatest asset in smoothing out these bumps.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Historical Performance:</strong> Looking back at the last 30 years of market data, portfolios with similar allocations have yielded positive returns in approximately {{positiveYears}} of rolling periods. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, it provides a strong statistical basis for your plan.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>The Advantage of Time:</strong> A {{timeHorizon}}-year investment timeline significantly reduces the probability of loss. Historical data indicates that the longer you stay invested, the higher your likelihood of positive returns, with {{timeHorizon}}-year periods showing a success rate of {{successRate}}.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Mitigating Market Timing Risk:</strong> Your strategy of investing {{ monthlyContribution }} monthly removes the stress of trying to \"time the market.\" This consistent participation ensures you capture market upswings while buying at a discount during downturns.</p>\n    \n    <p>Success in this {{goal}} strategy relies less on picking the \"perfect\" stock and more on maintaining discipline. Your ability to stay the course during market volatility will be the key determinant of your financial outcome.</p>\n  ",
      "strategy_analysis": "\n    <h2>Tailored Strategy for Your {{goal}} Goal</h2>\n    <p>Achieving a {{goal}} requires more than just saving; it demands a strategic allocation of capital. With {{timeHorizon}} years until your target, we recommend a dynamic approach that evolves with your changing needs.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Recommended Asset Allocation:</strong> To support a {{timeHorizon}}-year {{goal}} plan, a diversified mix is essential. Consider an allocation of roughly {{stockAllocation}} in equities (stocks) for growth, {{bondAllocation}} in fixed income (bonds) for stability, and {{alternativeAllocation}} in alternatives (like real estate or commodities) for diversification.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Glide Path Strategy:</strong> As you get closer to your goal, your strategy should shift from \"wealth accumulation\" to \"wealth preservation.\" We recommend gradually reducing exposure to volatile assets and increasing holdings in stable, income-generating assets as the {{timeHorizon}}-year mark approaches.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Contribution Impact:</strong> Your {{ monthlyContribution }} monthly contribution is the fuel for this engine, representing {{contributionPercentage}} of the total projected value. This emphasizes that your savings discipline is just as important as market returns.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Portfolio Rebalancing:</strong> Markets drift over time. We suggest reviewing your portfolio annually to rebalance back to your target allocation. This disciplined \"sell high, buy low\" approach helps manage risk and can enhance long-term returns by approximately 0.5% to 1% annually.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Tax Efficiency:</strong> Don't overlook the impact of taxes. Utilizing tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs or 401ks) for your {{goal}} savings can significantly boost your net returns. Consider holding tax-inefficient assets in these sheltered accounts.</p>\n  ",
      "comparative_scenarios": "\n    <h2>Comparative Investment Scenarios</h2>\n    <p>Understanding how different variables affect your investment outcome is crucial for optimizing your {{goal}} strategy. Here's a comprehensive analysis of how modifying key parameters could impact your financial future:</p>\n    \n    <h3>Higher Monthly Contributions</h3>\n    <p><strong>{{higherContribution}} Higher Contribution Strategy:</strong> Increasing your monthly investment to {{higherContribution}} could result in a portfolio value of {{higherContributionValue}}, representing an additional {{higherContributionGain}} compared to your current plan. This demonstrates how a {{contributionIncreasePercent}} increase in contributions can lead to a significantly larger portfolio.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Lower Monthly Contributions</h3>\n    <p><strong>{{lowerContribution}} Lower Contribution Scenario:</strong> If circumstances required reducing your monthly investment to {{lowerContribution}}, your portfolio would reach {{lowerContributionValue}}, which is {{lowerContributionLoss}} less than your current plan. This comparison highlights the importance of maintaining consistent contributions when possible.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Extended Timeline Analysis</h3>\n    <p><strong>Extended Timeline:</strong> If you could extend your investment period to {{extendedTimeline}} years, your portfolio could grow to {{extendedValue}}. This additional years in the market demonstrates the powerful impact of compound interest and the time value of money.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Shorter Timeline:</strong> Conversely, if you needed to reach your goal in fewer years ({{shorterTimeline}} years), your portfolio would be worth {{shorterValue}}. This scenario shows how reducing the investment timeline significantly impacts the final outcome.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Alternative Approaches</h3>\n    <p><strong>Conservative Approach ({{conservativeReturn}}):</strong> With a more cautious investment strategy, your portfolio could reach {{conservativeValue}}. While this reduces risk, it also limits growth potential.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Aggressive Approach ({{aggressiveReturn}}):</strong> A higher return strategy could potentially yield {{aggressiveValue}}, but comes with increased volatility and risk.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Lump Sum Investment vs Dollar-Cost Averaging</h3>\n    <p><strong>Lump Sum Investment:</strong> If you invested your total contribution amount ({{totalContributions}}) as a lump sum today, your portfolio could be worth {{lumpSumValue}} in {{timeHorizon}} years, compared to {{futureValue}} with monthly contributions. This demonstrates the trade-offs between immediate investment and dollar-cost averaging benefits.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Practical Decision-Making Insights</h3>\n    <p>These scenarios provide practical guidance for your {{goal}} strategy. The comparison between higher and lower contributions shows that even modest increases can have substantial long-term impacts. Consider whether increasing contributions by small amounts might be sustainable and worthwhile.</p>\n    \n    <p>Most effective strategies include starting early and staying invested longer. If you can delay accessing your funds, the additional years provide outsized benefits through compound growth with the greatest impact on your final portfolio value.</p>\n    \n    <p>Understanding these difference scenarios helps with making informed decision about trade-offs between security and growth potential. Your current {{annualReturn}} assumption represents a {{riskLevel}} approach that balances growth potential with reasonable risk management.</p>\n    \n    <p>The key takeaway is that small changes in your investment variables can significantly impact long-term outcomes. A {{contributionIncreasePercent}} increase in contribution leads to substantial final value improvement. Regular reviews and adjustments ensure your strategy remains aligned with your changing circumstances and {{goal}} objectives.</p>\n  ",

      "optimization_tips": "\n    <h2>Optimization Tips for Maximum Returns</h2>\n    <p>Fine-tuning your investment strategy can significantly impact your long-term results. Here are proven optimization techniques for your {{goal}} plan:</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Contribution Timing:</strong> Consider making your monthly contribution at the beginning of each month rather than the end. This simple change could add approximately {{ timingBenefit }} to your final portfolio value due to additional market exposure time.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Automatic Escalation:</strong> Set up automatic annual increases to your monthly contribution. Even a modest {{escalationPercent}} annual increase could boost your final portfolio value to {{ escalatedValue }}, adding {{ escalationBenefit }} to your wealth.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Tax-Advantaged Accounts:</strong> Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, or Roth IRAs. The tax savings could increase your effective return by {{taxSavings}}, significantly impacting long-term growth.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Fee Minimization:</strong> Reducing investment fees by just {{feeReduction}} annually could add {{ feeSavings }} to your final portfolio value. Focus on low-cost index funds and ETFs for core portfolio holdings.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Rebalancing Strategy:</strong> Implement a disciplined rebalancing approach. Annual rebalancing has historically added {{rebalancingBonus}} to returns by systematically buying low and selling high.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Windfall Integration:</strong> Plan to invest windfalls like bonuses, tax refunds, or inheritance. Adding just {{ windfallAmount }} annually could increase your final value to {{ windfallValue }}.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Behavioral Optimization:</strong> Automate everything possible to remove emotional decision-making. Automated investing, rebalancing, and contribution increases help maintain discipline during market turbulence.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Regular Review Schedule:</strong> Schedule semi-annual reviews to assess progress and make necessary adjustments. This disciplined approach ensures your strategy remains aligned with your {{goal}} objectives.</p>\n    \n    <p>Remember, optimization is about consistent improvement over time, not perfection. Small, systematic improvements compound over your {{timeHorizon}}-year investment journey to create substantial additional wealth.</p>\n  ",
      "market_context": "\n    <h2>Current Market Context & Economic Outlook</h2>\n    <p>Successful investing requires understanding the broader economic landscape. Here is how current market conditions relate to your {{timeHorizon}}-year {{goal}} plan.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Economic Environment:</strong> We are currently navigating a period with {{currentInflation}} inflation and interest rates around {{currentInterestRates}}. While market volatility is currently {{marketVolatility}}, your {{annualReturn}} return assumption is realistic given historical averages for diversified portfolios.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Inflation & Purchasing Power:</strong> Inflation is the silent eroder of wealth. With inflation at {{currentInflation}}, your \"real\" return (what you actually keep in purchasing power) is approximately {{realReturn}}. Investing is one of the few reliable ways to outpace inflation and grow your standard of living over time.</p>\n    \n    <p><strong>Market Cycles:</strong> Over a {{timeHorizon}}-year period, you should expect to encounter approximately {{expectedCycles}} full market cycles (bull and bear markets).
