# Task 21: Homepage Layout Reorganization Completion Summary

## Task Requirements

- Move the scenario explorer (predefined scenarios) from the `/scenario` page to the homepage
- Add a "recently created scenarios" section to the homepage
- Ensure the calculator appears immediately after the hero section on the homepage
- Make only these changes without breaking or altering unrelated functionality

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Homepage Layout Reordering

- Moved the calculator section to appear immediately after the hero section on the homepage
- Ensured the predefined scenarios section follows the calculator
- Added the recently created scenarios section as the final section on the homepage
- The final order is now: Hero → Calculator → Predefined Scenarios → Recent Scenarios

### 2. Scenario Explorer Page Update

- Updated the standalone `/scenario` page to redirect to the homepage
- This ensures users looking for the scenario explorer are directed to the consolidated experience on the homepage
- Maintains backward compatibility for any existing links to the scenario page

### 3. Code Cleanup

- Fixed a syntax error in the redirect code by adding a semicolon
- Removed a duplicate calculator section that appeared at the bottom of the page

## Verification

- The development server runs without errors
- The homepage displays the correct section order:
  1. Hero section at the top
  2. Calculator immediately after the hero section
  3. Predefined scenarios after the calculator
  4. Recently created scenarios at the bottom
- The `/scenario` route redirects to the homepage

## Backward Compatibility

- All individual scenario pages at `/scenario/[slug]` remain accessible
- Existing links to specific scenarios continue to work as expected
- The user experience is simplified by consolidating the scenario exploration and calculator on the homepage
